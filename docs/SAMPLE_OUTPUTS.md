## üé§ Raw Whisper Transcription

Initial transcription output from the `transcribe.py` module.

### Input
Audio excerpt: "Um, hello everyone, uh, welcome to our podcast. Today we're gonna discuss, like, artificial intelligence in education..."

### Output: `sample_transcript.json`
```json
[
  {
    "start": 0.0,
    "end": 3.24,
    "text": " Um, hello everyone, uh, welcome to our podcast."
  },
  {
    "start": 3.24,
    "end": 8.46,
    "text": " Today we're gonna discuss, like, artificial intelligence in education."
  },
  {
    "start": 8.46,
    "end": 12.18,
    "text": " There's a lot of interesting applications there."
  },
  {
    "start": 12.18,
    "end": 16.92,
    "text": " AI can really help personalize learning for each student."
  },
  {
    "start": 16.92,
    "end": 21.36,
    "text": " It's able to adapt to there learning style and pace."
  }
]
```

**Characteristics:**
- Raw speech-to-text conversion
- Includes filler words ("um", "uh", "like")
- May contain transcription errors ("there" instead of "their")
- Preserves natural speech patterns

## üë• Speaker Diarization

Output after adding speaker identification using `diarize_transcript.py`.

### Advanced Diarization Output: `sample_diarized.json`
```json
[
  {
    "start": 0.0,
    "end": 8.46,
    "text": "Um, hello everyone, uh, welcome to our podcast. Today we're gonna discuss, like, artificial intelligence in education.",
    "speaker": "SPEAKER_00"
  },
  {
    "start": 8.46,
    "end": 12.18,
    "text": "There's a lot of interesting applications there.",
    "speaker": "SPEAKER_00"
  },
  {
    "start": 12.18,
    "end": 16.92,
    "text": "AI can really help personalize learning for each student.",
    "speaker": "SPEAKER_00"
  },
  {
    "start": 16.92,
    "end": 21.36,
    "text": "That sounds fascinating. Can you give us some specific examples?",
    "speaker": "SPEAKER_01"
  },
  {
    "start": 21.36,
    "end": 26.84,
    "text": "Absolutely. One example is adaptive testing systems.",
    "speaker": "SPEAKER_00"
  }
]
```

### Simple Diarization Output: `sample_simple_diarized.json`
```json
[
  {
    "start": 0.0,
    "end": 8.46,
    "text": "Um, hello everyone, uh, welcome to our podcast. Today we're gonna discuss, like, artificial intelligence in education.",
    "speaker": "SPEAKER_00"
  },
  {
    "start": 8.46,
    "end": 16.92,
    "text": "There's a lot of interesting applications there. AI can really help personalize learning for each student.",
    "speaker": "SPEAKER_00"
  },
  {
    "start": 18.24,
    "end": 21.36,
    "text": "That sounds fascinating. Can you give us some specific examples?",
    "speaker": "SPEAKER_01"
  }
]
```

**Characteristics:**
- Adds speaker labels (SPEAKER_00, SPEAKER_01, etc.)
- Advanced: Uses AI models for accurate speaker identification
- Simple: Uses timing gaps to detect speaker changes
- May merge segments from the same speaker
